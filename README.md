this is my portfolio/personal website. it's not very optimized, but at least it's kinda pretty i guess

## i have no idea what to write here

i was sick of the default react+vite readme so have my incoherent ramblings instead

## honestly the site is so mediocre i kinda wanna rewrite it a second time

maybe use this as an excuse to learn next or svelte or something

or make a blog with next's ssg

but i have no idea what to write about and i'm not sure if anyone would be willing to suffer through my writing

i mean hey if you made it this far in the readme you might be the target audience

## cool footer here

licensed under the mit license, do whatever you want with it as long as you credit me i guess, i don't really care
